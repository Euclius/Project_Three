## Version Two Desires
Have a third model for comments. Stylize more. I too wanted a map to have a visual component so that the users can see where the activity is taking place; my plans were to use the javascript library leaflet. I too wanted to stylize with the keystone library. We had done a thumbs up or down in the gif exercise and I wanted to implement that. I also wanted to have an expand and a collapse button that would be underneath the title of the activity, which when clicked would show the description and legality (the properties of activity)
